## Call Flow Process

### 1. Call Reception
```
Carrier calls → AI greets professionally → Requests MC number
```

### 2. Carrier Authentication
```
MC number provided → FMCSA verification → Validates carrier eligibility
```

### 3. Load Matching
```
Carrier preferences → AI searches available loads → Presents best matches
```

### 4. Load Presentation
```
AI describes load details → Confirms carrier interest → Proceeds to pricing
```

### 5. Price Negotiation
```
AI presents listed rate → Carrier makes offer → AI negotiates intelligently
- Round 1: Accept if within 10% of listed rate
- Round 2: Counter with 5% increase if needed
- Round 3: Final offer or transfer to sales rep
```

### 6. Deal Closure
```
Price agreed → AI transfers to sales rep → Collects all relevant data
```
